            Muir Woods National Monument is a National Park located just 12 miles north of San Francisco, CA, which makes it a great escape from the city. Throughout the park you can see the beautiful redwood trees, many of which are over 800 years old and over 250 feet tall.

            One of the least visited, yet largest, of the national parks, you can explore incredible landscapes, unique geology, and one of a kind plant and animal life in utter silence – or over warm conversation with the park staff.

            Sometimes it’s the simple things that amaze us. These two brightly colored birds seem madly in love.
